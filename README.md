This repository contains the data and analysis script for my Master's Thesis. The analysis is provided in a form suited for open code submission (single script containing only information relating to contents
of the corresponding manuscript).
The script mostly contains some basic data wrangling, descriptives a string of mixed models, and some visualizations and is thus scripting wise not very sophisticated.
